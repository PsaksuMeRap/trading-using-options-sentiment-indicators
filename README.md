This course will help you to understand the two major emotions that drive the entire market - Fear and Greed and how we can capitalize on them to make profits.

#### Highlights of the course are:

1.  Creation of a strong foundation regarding the concepts of sentiment trading, sentiment indicators such as TRIN or Arms index or Short term Trading Index, Put/Call ratio and Volatility Index, how to interpret them.
2.  How to interpret the sentiment indicators and devise trading strategies using sentiment indicators.
3.  Developing a trading logic by using signals from the sentiment indicators and coding using Python programming language.
4.  Analyze the strategy in Microsoft Excel using 2 years of historical data for backtesting.
5.  Various risks involved in while trading using sentiment indicators.

## Breadth Measures
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

The folder contains the following topics:

**Fetching data:**
An [exercise](https://quantra.quantinsti.com/startCourseDetails?cid=39&section_no=2&unit_no=11) where you will learn how to fetch data for S&amp;P 500 futures contracts, advancing stocks and declining stocks on NYSE from Quandl.

**Defining Bollinger Bands:**
An [exercise](https://quantra.quantinsti.com/startCourseDetails?cid=39&section_no=2&unit_no=12) where you will learn to define the upper and lower Bollinger bands.

**Identifying crossovers:**
An [exercise](https://quantra.quantinsti.com/startCourseDetails?cid=39&section_no=2&unit_no=13) where you will learn to set values for flags/boolean variables (variables storing either True or False) for moving average and stop loss band crossovers.

**Generating Buy Signals:**
An [exercise](https://quantra.quantinsti.com/startCourseDetails?cid=39&section_no=2&unit_no=14) where you will learn to check the condition for opening a Buy position when the upper Bollinger band is crossed and assign an appropriate value to the variable ‘flag’.


## Option Trading Measures
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

The folder contains the following topics:

**Generating a Sell Signal:**

An [exercise](https://quantra.quantinsti.com/startCourseDetails?cid=39&section_no=3&unit_no=13) where you will learn how to place a 'SELL' order if PCR crosses below the lower Bollinger band since it is a sign of an overbought market. We will take a contrarian position amid this bullish sentiment.

**Closing an open sell position 1:**
An [exercise](https://quantra.quantinsti.com/startCourseDetails?cid=39&section_no=3&unit_no=14) where you will learn to place a buy order to close the open short position.

**Closing an open sell position 2:**
An [exercise](https://quantra.quantinsti.com/startCourseDetails?cid=39&section_no=3&unit_no=15) where you will learn to close the open short position if PCR crosses the Lower Stoploss Band, i.e. PCR continues to fall after crossing the LBB, by placing a 'BUY' order, booking a loss.

**Closing an open sell position 3:**
An [exercise](https://quantra.quantinsti.com/startCourseDetails?cid=39&section_no=3&unit_no=16) where you will learn to close an open short position by placing a buy order if the absolute stop loss value triggers a signal to close the position.

**Closing an open Buy position:**
An [exercise](https://quantra.quantinsti.com/startCourseDetails?cid=39&section_no=3&unit_no=17) where you will learn to place a sell order to close the open buy position.


## Volatility Measures
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)


**Generating a buy order:**
An [exercise](https://quantra.quantinsti.com/startCourseDetails?cid=39&section_no=4&unit_no=11) where you will learn how to generate an order to buy S&amp;P 500 futures contracts, if the value of VIX exceeds the threshold value (i.e. thresh = 22).

**Closing an open Buy position 1:**
An [exercise](https://quantra.quantinsti.com/startCourseDetails?cid=39&section_no=4&unit_no=12) where you will learn to check if the value of VIX exceeds the threshold value (i.e. thresh = 22); we will buy S&amp;P 500 futures. In this exercise, if the S&amp;P 500 futures contract value is trading 5% above its bought price, we will sell the contract and book a profit. We will then update the required fields and flags to avoid conflicts in our codes.

**Closing an open Buy position 2:**
An [exercise](https://quantra.quantinsti.com/startCourseDetails?cid=39&section_no=4&unit_no=13) where you will learn to check if the value of VIX exceeds the threshold value (i.e. thresh = 22); then we will buy S&amp;P 500 futures. If the S&amp;P 500 futures value is 5% above its bought price, we will sell the futures contract and book a profit. In this exercise, if the S&amp;P 500 futures value is 5% below its bought price, we will sell the futures contract and book a loss (our stoploss condition). We will then update the required fields and flags to avoid conflicts in our codes.

**Appending trade data:**
An [exercise](https://quantra.quantinsti.com/startCourseDetails?cid=39&section_no=4&unit_no=14) where you will learn to use the append() method. The append() method adds a single item to an existing list. It does not return a new list, but it rather modifies the original list. We will modify the ‘stoploss' and ‘mtm’ list in this exercise.
